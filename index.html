                It's that time. Hearts are beating and we're trying to figure out whether the next week is going to be interesting or terrifying....or both. It's Quarter Three project time at Galvanize. My partner and I are students in the Full-Stack Immersive course
                for WebDev and have enjoyed every minute of it. Up until now we've worked with Javascript, Node, Angular, and quite a few other framworks/libraries in our race to our new career change. After 4 months of working with the curriculum we've
                been encouraged to branch out and try something new for our Q3 project, go a little nuts.
            </p>

            <p>
                My partner and I have decided to build a smart TV/Chromecast apparatus from the ground up using a Raspberry Pi. Our end goal is hook up the Pi to a monitor or TV and play content from Youtube to it from another device. We have the Pi and start researching
                what technologies we'll need to accomplish this.

            <p>
                After our severe brainstorming session shown above we settle on: Angular, Express, Node, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3...all things we've worked with but we're throwing in two new technologies we've never seen before: Ionic for mobile and Socket.io. With that
                said we hit the books and setup a time for the following day to get the Pi unboxed and started.

                Working with the Pi has been surprisingly easy. Installation of the pieces/parts was pretty minimal and the OS install (Raspbian) was decently quick. It’s crazy to think that something so small is at the forefront of so many different projects and applications.
                Interesting to see how computing and software has become a hobby rather than something people typically spent so many years pursuing in full-fledged education.

            <p>
                After the OS install we set about downloading the different programs we would need such as Chromium, OMXPlayer, and Youtube-DL. Truth be told we knocked off quite a bit because every little thing blew our damn mind. It’s like playing with a new toy, just
                a really, really geeky one. These packages took a little longer but in the mean time we were able to setup remote desktop and file share on the Pi so we wouldn’t have to always have it connected to a display which would help keep us a
                bit more organized.

                Joey is opting to work on the mobile application via Ionic and is having a blast figuring out the new framework. I've decided to create the server side and get to work creating the initial Express app and routes. Thanks to our instructors, Express apps
                are our bread and butter so it's done relatively easily. Unfortuantely we hit a snag using Socket.io. It's our first time utilizing the module and we can't seem to be able to connect our MacBooks with the Pi in a basic test. During our
                initial tests and experimenting we had used a PC and were able to get things done swiftly but it's quite the opposite right now. Looks like it's time to hit the documentation....

                After roughly two hours of research and trying everything in the freakin book we realize it's a node issue which of course isn't listed anywhere. Rolling back from Node 7.0 to 6.4 resolves it and we're about ready for a damn beer. It turns out that when
                Google doesn't have the answer to your issue, crying and muttering curses will usually get it solved after a bit. We have a few things to take care of in class so the project gets put away for a bit and it's off to working at home over
                Slack. A little bit of a rocky start to the week but we're confident in our skills and know we're going to be sucessful.

        <p>Side note - We took a break and made cereal suicides. The perfect thing to boost brain power and maybe a little self-loating.</p>

                We may have overestimated our workaround to the connection issues. We've hit a pretty big roadblock in gettin the Pi connected and talking to one of our computers. From what we can find it seems we're now dealing with an authorization issue concerning
                our school's encrypted network. We know we can get it working at home but that would leave all changes made during the day untestable until we get home.
            </p>

            <p>
                After several different attempts and sudo commands (DON'T DO IT) we have totally and completely ruined everything. We can't even connect to a wifi spot with the Pi. After a little deliberation we decide to burn it down and start over. We wipe the drive
                and completely reinstall the OS and all the packages again. Fast forward to a newly setup Pi and our Fearless Instructor gives us a nudge in the right direction: start a Python server on our Pi and try to connect with other devices via
                HTTP requests. IT FREAKING WORKS. We high five, laugh, and internally stop screaming over anxiety and despair. It's a pretty good moment. For the evening we decide to read over things a bit more to try and be better prepared.

        <h5>Wednesday, November 11/16</h5>

        <div class="">
            <p>
                It's a new day and now knowing we can have a basic connection from our computers to the Pi we decide to push forward and build some stuff. Joey decides to really slam on Ionic and says he'll have the app designed and done by the end of the day. I step
                up and start working on how we're going to implement our back end and utilize Socket.io.
            </p>

            <p>
                For those not in know...as we were three days prior, Socket allows your backend and client side to "talk" to each other witout having to utilize URL routes or design. What we have designed is an Angular "single page" app using a standard index.html file
                and building the multiple "pages" of the mobile app design within that one file. We really don't have any routes per se since we're just moving around one page.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p></p>
        <img src="http://www.masternote.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/transmission-tower-smoothed-edges.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="" />
        <p></p>

        <div class="">
            <p>
                I decided to bring in Socket as a broadcast system. Our app has a search page where utilizing the Youtube API we can make a call and search for videos on their site. We display them nicely and present the user with a watch button. I attach a function
                to the button that utilizes a method from the Socket library called EMIT. We send out a code word, "video", and message which is essentially an object containin the id of the video.
            </p>

            <p>
                On our server side we have a Socket methond called ON that listens for any broadcasts sent. Once it hears the code word "video" it launches a function we've written that will input various shell commands within the terminal application on the Pi. Namely
                using Youtube-dl to find the video associated to the id and download it, then open the MP4 application using the OMXPlayer on the Pi. After the video plays it will auto exit and await any other further transmissions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I get the backend written up and then Joey floors me with his app design. Note to everyone out there: Ionic is amazing and you should praise it. We ooh and ahh over the look and realize it's about time to go home. Looks like the next day is going through
                and wiring the front end to the back end and seeing the fruits of our labor.

        <div class="">
            <p>
                We start the morning off a little sleepy but jump right into it. We get to work connecting our functions written to the appropriate tags in the HTML/Ionic code. Takes a few minutes and some adjustments in code as far as naming conventions goes but it's
                still pretty smooth. We get our master branch updated, install Git on the Pi then pull our repo on it and start a simple Python server. On our MacBooks we navigate to the ip address of the Pi and the appropriate port. We launch our app
                and search for video, it seems our Youtube call and API key are working just fine. We click watch.....and nothing happens. We decide to put a few console.logs in our code to make sure we're getting the appropriate ID and then launching
                our Socket signal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p></p>
        <img src="public/images/Screen Shot 2016-11-18 at 11.14.44 AM.png" class="img-rounded" alt="" id="mobile" />
        <p></p>

        <div class="">
            <p>
                So it seems we're getting the proper Youtube Id, and keeping it in the proper format but we're not sending our "video" signal to our server side...or we're sending it and not listening to it. It's either/or at this point and we need a way to identify
                it.
