                It's that time. Hearts are beating and we're trying to figure out whether the next week is going to be interesting or terrifying....or both. It's Quarter Three project time at Galvanize. My partner and I are students in the Full-Stack Immersive course
                for WebDev and have enjoyed every minute of it. Up until now we've worked with Javascript, Node, Angular, and quite a few other framworks/libraries in our race to our new career change. After 4 months of working with the curriculum we've
                been encouraged to branch out and try something new for our Q3 project, go a little nuts.
            </p>

            <p>
                My partner and I have decided to build a smart TV/Chromecast apparatus from the ground up using a Raspberry Pi. Our end goal is hook up the Pi to a monitor or TV and play content from Youtube to it from another device. We have the Pi and start researching
                what technologies we'll need to accomplish this.

                After our severe brainstorming session shown above we settle on: Angular, Express, Node, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3...all things we've worked with but we're throwing in two new technologies we've never seen before: Ionic for mobile and Socket.io. With that
                said we hit the books and setup a time for the following day to get the Pi unboxed and started.

                Working with the Pi has been surprisingly easy. Installation of the pieces/parts was pretty minimal and the OS install (Raspbian) was decently quick. It’s crazy to think that something so small is at the forefront of so many different projects and applications.
                Interesting to see how computing and software has become a hobby rather than something people typically spent so many years pursuing in full-fledged education.

            <p>
                After the OS install we set about downloading the different programs we would need such as Chromium, OMXPlayer, and Youtube-DL. Truth be told we knocked off quite a bit because every little thing blew our damn mind. It’s like playing with a new toy, just
                a really, really geeky one. These packages took a little longer but in the mean time we were able to setup remote desktop and file share on the Pi so we wouldn’t have to always have it connected to a display which would help keep us a
                bit more organized.

                After a few more minutes of playing around and tinkering we decided to call our first project session to an end and a success.

                Joey is opting to work on the mobile application via Ionic and having a blast figuring out the new framework. I've decided to create the server side and get to work creating the initial Express app and routes. Thanks to our instructors, Express apps are
                our bread and butter so it's done relatively easily. Unfortuantely we hit a snag using Socket.io. It's our first time utilizing the module and we can't seem to be able to connect our MacBooks with the Pi. During our initial tests and experimenting
                we had used a PC and were able to get things done swiftly but it's quite the opposite right now. Looks like it's time to hit the documentation....

                After roughly two hours of research and trying everything in the freakin book we realize it's a node issue. Rolling back from Node 7.0 to 6.4 resolves it and we're about ready for a damn beer. It turns out that when Google doesn't have the answer to your
                issue, crying and muttering curses will usually get it solved after a bit. We have a few things to take care of in class so the project gets put away for a bit and it's off to working at home over Slack. A little bit of a rocky start to
                the week but we're confident in our skills and know we're going to be sucessful.

                We may have overestimated our workaround to the connection issues. We've hit a pretty big roadblock in gettin the Pi connected and talking to one of our computers. From what we can find it seems to be an authorization issue concerning our school's encrypted
                network. We know we can get it working at home but that would leave all changes made during the day untestable until we get home.
            </p>

            <p>
                After several different attempts and sudo commands (DON'T DO IT) we have totally and completely ruined everything. We can't even connect to a wifi spot with the Pi. After a little deliberation we decide to burn it down and start over. We wipe the drive
                and completely reinstall the OS and all the packages again. Fast forward to a newly setup Pi and our Fearless Instructor gives us a nudge in the right direction. We start a Python server on our Pi can connect other devices via HTTP requests.
                IT FREAKING WORKS. We high five, laugh, and internally stop screaming over anxiety and despair. It's a pretty good moment.
            </p>

            <p>
                We give our basic backend a whirl and START STREAMING A YOUTUBE VIDEO FROM OUR PHONES TO THE PI. All is well with the world. The down side is that this has taken most of the day but with renewed vigor we make a plan for what we're working on in the evening
                and set to it. Now that we have a basic setup it's time to build the front end application and add features so we can have a solid Quarter Three project.
